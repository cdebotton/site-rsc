			<p>
				Hello! I&apos;m a software engineer based in San Francisco, California.
				I&apos;ve worked on teams building consumer facing products, internal
				tooling, design systems, and developer libraries. At the computer, I
				spend most of my time writing React, Svelte, and Rust. Otherwise,
				I&apos;m taking pictures on film or digital, shooting video, or watching
				movies with my wife and dog.
